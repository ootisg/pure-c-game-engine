This is a simple game engine I'm making for fun. If you want to use it, go ahead (but do so at your own risk as it's unfinished). I'm specifically making this because I wanted to make a game engine in c.
Never done a README before, so this is a WIP
This library is also a WIP

How to build:
	This library has the following dependancies:
		- Win32 (this is a WINDOWS ONLY library)
		- OpenGL version 3.0 or higher
		- GLU
		- freeglut
		- GLEW (put the source glew.c file in the project directory, header can go wherever as long as it's accessable)
		- lodepng (put the .c and .h files in the project directory)
	1) Download and install OpenGL if you haven't already
	2) Make sure you have gnu make and gcc installed
	3) Download and install GLU and freeglut (these libraries should be in your lib directory)
	4) Download glew.c and glew.h, and put glew.c in the project's source directory. glew.h can go in your include directory.
	5) Build with gnu make using the provided Makefile
